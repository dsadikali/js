                          <h3>MYSTICS' DESCRIPTIONS OF GREEN VISIONS</h3>
                          <p style="text-align:center">(c) 2011 Philip T. Nicholson</p>
                          <p>This list contains 41 entries encompassing
                            the world's major religous traditions</p>
                          <h4>"THE WATERHOLE THAT LEADS TO DREAMTIME"(Australia, ca. 50,000 BCE).</h4>
                          <p>To guide their meditations, the Aborigine "Men of High Degree" create an image consisting of 3 to 6 concentric rings, a symbol of the "energy centers" called "sacred waterholes."  These waterholes are the portals that allow spirits and humans to move between the Dreamtime and ordinary reality.  The symbol of 3 to 6 concentric circles represents the vision of 3 to 6 green light-rings that the "Men of High Degree" see as they enter the Dreamtime.</p>
                          <h4>"THE RAINBOW SERPENT"(Australia, ca. 50,000 BCE).</h4>
                          <p> This ancient ancestral spirit of the Aborigines can manifest in 2 ways:  it can appear in the sky (as a "Day-Crawler") or in the Dreamtime (as an "Eye-Thing)."  In the Dreamtime, the body of the spirit glows with green, blue, or purple lights that can be seen by "Men of High Degree" who are seeking power.  The "fire" colors of yellow, orange, and red which are burning the back of the "Day-Crawler" are extinguished when the Serpent dives into the Dreamtime through a "sacred waterhole".</p>
                          <h4>"THE EYE OF HORUS"(Egypt, ca. 2500 BCE).</h4>
                          <p>A green oval line was painted on the foreheads of mummies as priests chanted to summon the dissembodied "Eye of Horus," the Falcon God, also called "The Green One," to come carry the kings' souls into the Underworld.  The priests believed this because they'd seen "receding" green light-rings when they put on "garments of light" to enter the Underworld themselves.  The priests also said the skin of the gods was green.</p>
                          <h4>"THE RADIANT WHEELS"(India, ca. 1500 BCE).</h4>
                          <p> In the hymns of the Rig Veda, Indo-Aryan priests describe the auspicious vision of a chariot consisting of 3 "radiant wheels" where the "rims of the wheels are bent by the minds of the priests."  The radiant wheels "fly away from the viewer, . . . with no horses attached." One verse says the wheels are "verdant" in color.</p>
                          <h4>"THE LIMITED-LIGHT VISIONS OF THE BUDDHAS"(India, 563-483 BCE).</h4>
                          <p> While Gotama the Buddha meditated all night beneath a Banyan tree, he saw "limited light-manifestations" until suddenly, just before dawn, the "Divine Eye opened" (caksus uppada), flooding his mind with a "boundless light-manifestation."  Gotama does not describe the "limited-lights," but religious artwork created by his followers in the temples of the Silk Road and China almost always show the "Enlightened Ones" floating amid celestial mists of green (or dark blue) or wearing robes with prominent flares of green (or dark blue).</p>
                          <h4>"WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS" (Babylon, ca. 500 BCE).</h4>
                          <p> Ezekiel, a Hebrew priest in exile, saw a vision that included 4 wheels, "beryl" in color (aquamarine or emerald), "their construction being something like a wheel within a wheel."  The wheels moved in a straight line "without veering" when he turned his head.  Ezekiel also said he saw a vision of "splendor all around" that shone with the colors of a rainbow.</p>
                          <h4> "THE CIRCLING YANG ENERGY"(China, ca. 32 BCE).</h4>
                          <p> The Daoist "Celestial Master" Zhang Ling's The Scripture of Great Peace advises seekers to "Guard the Light of the One" (Shou-i) by sitting quietly with eyes closed until "a brilliant light" arises: "The splendor of Yang starts to shine and spreads it light . . . Its chi [energy] turns and circles like the wheels of a chariot."</p>
                          <h4>"K'AWIL'S VISION SERPENT"(Mesoamerica, ca. 250-1200 CE).</h4>
                          <p> K'awil, Mayan god of life-force and transitional states, uses the gullet of his spirit companion (uay), K'ukumatz, the feathered "Vision Serpent," as the conduit for sending the spirits of dead notables up to the Milky Way or back to earth.  The serpent's feathers are iridescent green and blue—the colors of the quetzal bird.  The Aztecs adopted the Mayan myth and called their Plumed Serpent, Quetzalcoatl.</p>
                          <h4>"PRECIOUS-BLUE-GREEN-LIGHTNING" (Mesoamerica, ca. 250-1200).</h4>
                          <p> Jurakán, Mayan god of thunderstorms and lightning, manifests in 3 guises:  as lightning-bolts, as flashes of sheet lightning, or as Räxa-lightning.  Räxa can mean "green," "blue," or "precious" lightning.  A symbol associated with Jurakán is a flint axehead implanted in the forehead of a god or a vision serpent or a Mayan king in the process of being transformed into a god.  The axehead smokes, which points to a fire-in-the-mind's eye, which would explain why the Mayans spoke of a "precious" lightning that can be either blue or green.</p>
                          <h4> "YELLOW COURT OF THE HEART" (China, ca. 300 CE).</h4>
                          <p> The Book of Great Profundity (Ta-tung iing), an important text for "Highest Purity" Daoists, says the first spirits to appear in the meditator's "Yellow Court of the Heart" are yellowish-green lights, a mix of green "energy" (chi) from the "Original Father" in the head and yellow "energy" from the "Original Mother" at the base of the trunk.</p>
                          <h4>"ORBED PHOSPHORS" (China, ca. 330 CE).</h4>
                          <p> Daoist Master Yang Xi, author of another important "Highest Purity" treatise, The Upper Scripture of Purple Texts, advised those who wanted to be "Perfected Beings" to use the technique of "visualization" (cunjian) and picture colored lights circulating through the body.  Eventually the gods will take pity and send down their celestial lights, "the Cloudsouls of the Sun," lights that flow spontaneously.  Among these celestial lights are visions of "Orbed Phosphors" and "Green (Rainbow) Glare."</p>
                          <h4>"GIRDLES OF JADE" (China, ca. 330).</h4>
                          <p> In yet another treatise of the "Highest Purity" school of Daoism, meditators are advised to "visualize the energy of the Jade Girdle descending from the Nine Heavens and encircling the body."  Jade is often green, and green light-rings sweep in from all sides as if "encircling" the body.</p>
                          <h4>"EYES OF THE CHERUBIM" (Syria, 6th C.).</h4>
                          <p> Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, an anonymous Christian mystic, writes in The Divine Names that "The Good is described as the light of the mind . . . . At first it deals out the light in small amounts and then, as the wish and the longing for light begins to grow, it gives more and more of itself."  In The Celestial Hierarchy, he says that "where there is no intermediary between the mystic and God" there is a light like "the most holy 'thrones' and orders said to possess many eyes and many wings, called in Hebrew the 'cherubim' and 'seraphim'."</p>
                          <h4>"WHIRLING FIREBRANDS" (Ceylon, ca. 5th C.).</h4>
                          <p> Buddhaghosa, in his Pali text, Visshuddhimagga, "Path of Purification," one of the foundations of the Theravadin school of Buddhism, says light visions ("illuminations") are a "beginner's samadhi" that distracts meditators from the True Path.  He points to the illusory nature of these visions:  "formations appear to him as perpetually renewed;"  "they are also short-lived like dew-drops at sunrise . . . like a bubble on water;" "And they appear without core, like a conjuring trick . . . like a mirage . . . like the circle of a whirling firebrand [20: 104]."</p>
                          <h4>"A LOTUS TREE, ENSHROUDED" (Arabian Peninsula, 610).</h4>
                          <p> "My eyes sleep but my heart is awake," said the Prophet Muhammed when asked how he prayed.  It was while he on retreat and praying in a cave that he saw "the Signs of my Lord" [Quran 53: 1-12] far away on a clear horizon.  When the "Signs" reappeared a second time, they'd moved to "within the shot of a bow" and were situated "near the Lotus Tree that marks the boundary of the Garden of the Abode."  Beyond this boundary, Allah dwells unseen by humans.  A lotus tree has a bower of leaves that form a green disk.  Muhammed's vision of the Lotus Tree was "enshrouded in what it was enshrouded." Later he would explain that "It was covered in colours, I do not know what they are . . . . [Hadith, al-Bukhaari]."</p>
                          <h4>"THE GREEN CUSHIONS OF PARADISE" (Arabian Peninsula, 610).</h4>
                          <p> The Prophet Muhammed also saw visions of the "green rafraf of the believers living in Paradise [Quran 55: 76]."  The Arabic word, rafraf, means "litters" or "cushions."  Many Sufi mystics who see visions refer to this passage in the Quran.</p>
                          <h4>"TUBA TREE NUT CASINGS" (Arabian Peninsula, 610).</h4>
                          <p> On another occasion, the Prophet Muhammed saw a vision of a giant Tuba Tree in Paradise, and he said the dwellers in Paradise used the outer casings surrounding the nuts of this giant Tuba Tree to make their clothes.  The casings that enclose ordinary tuba tree nuts are green spheres that look like big green grapes.</p>
                          <h4>"THE GREEN HEART-CHAKRA" (India, 950-1020).</h4>
                          <p> The Hindu guru, Abhinavagupta, author of the Tantraloka ("Light of Tantra"), says the first vision seen by skilled meditators will be the green light emanating from the "heart chakra."  This word, chakra, refers to a hierarchy of "subtle energy centers" aligned with the human body and also to the type of light emitted by each center.  When a "subtle" spiritual energy called kundalini rises up through the chakras, it releases a specific color of light. </p>
                          <h4>"A CIRCULAR MIST" (Greece, 949-1022).</h4>
                          <p>In Hymns of Divine Love, Symeon the New Theologian, a Christian monk who lived in Byzantine Greece, describes his first vision: "Suddenly a flood of divine radiance descended like a bright cloud of mist" that "seemed to surround my head entirely," and then the mist moved "into the center of my heart" where it "appeared like a sun, round as a circle." </p>
                          <h4>"4 WHEELS LIKE UMBRELLAS" (India, 956-1041).</h4>
                          <p>In his influential anthology entitled The Epitome of the Six Yogas, a Tantric Buddhist teacher named Naropa summarized the most effective meditation practices for attaining Enlightenment in a single lifetime, called "Highest Yoga Tantra" (maha-anuttara-yoga.)  In one chapter, "The Yoga of Psychic Heat," Naropa advised meditators to remember an old saying: "Meditate on 4 wheels, each like an umbrella."  Light-wheels like umbrellas because the rims shrink in diameter like the rims of umbrellas collapsed by their owners.  Naropa also says the first signs of spiritual progress are "phenomena appearing like smoke, mirage, and fireflies," and a sensation of inner heat (phumo).</p>
                          <h4>"THE HALO OF 5 LIGHTS" (Tibet, 1012-1097).</h4>
                          <p>Marpa Lotsawa, a Buddhist monk from Tibet, studied with Naropa, translated The Six Yogas into the Tibetan language, and brought that book  back with him when he returned to his native land.  In his book, Elucidation of the Summary of the Five Stages, Marpa advised meditators that when they see lights begin to flow spontaneously, "First one experiences the hallucination-like sign that arises with the halo of five lights."</p>
                          <h4>"THE RAINBOW VAJRA-BODY" (Tibet, 1052-1135).</h4>
                          <p> Jetsun Milarepa, a disciple of Marpa the Translator, lived for years as a solitary hermit practicing severe austerities—not wearing clothes during cold Tibetan winters, not eating for days, or eating nettles. Milarepa told his followers that he saw his true self in his mind's eye as a "rainbow vajra-body."  The word, "vajra," means "lightning," so his true body appeared as a series of lights with rainbow colors.  He also said his "real form" was a "green light," not his physical body.</p>
                          <h4>"THE COSMIC WHEELS" (Germany, 1098-1179).</h4>
                          <p> The Christian nun and abbotess, Hildegard of Bingen, saw visions of a white light that appeared spontaneously, but she also saw visions of a different type of vision that appeared while she was deep in prayer.  She illustrated what she'd seen by making paintings, and in these works Hildegard returns again and again to a distinctive image in which rings of light are prominently displayed.  She paints these rings with blues and grays rather than greens, but the shape is unmistakeable.  Examples include the paintings called "The Man in Sapphire Blue," "Egg of the Universe," and "The Cosmic Wheel." </p>
                          <h4>"A PEARL GLOWS ON MT. QAF" (Iran, 1152-1191).</h4>
                          <p> In The Red Intellect, Yahya Suhrawardi, founder of the Sufi Order of "Illuminationists," placed special emphasis on seeing visions of colored light.  He advised meditators to trust Khidr, "The Green One," known to Sufis as the "Teacher of Prophets," to guide them forward. He also told them to watch for the vision of "The Pearl-that-glows-by-night-on-Mount Qaf."  This "Pearl" is a vision of green light that is reflected off the green bowers of the Tuba Tree Muhammed saw in Paradise.  The vision begins in blackness, but then the meditator sees a green "Pearl" that is moving away, accumulating more light as it moves, and then, when it reaches it farthest extent, it captures the full image of the Tuba Tree, becoming a sphere of green light.</p>
                          <h4>"THE SHRINKING WELL" (Iran, 1145-1220).</h4>
                          <p> In his book, Visio Smaragdina, the Iranian Sufi Illuminationist, Najmoddin Kubra, advises meditators that they will feel as if they are falling down into a deep, dark well when actually their spirits are moving upward:  "It may happen that you visualize yourself as lying at the bottom of a well and the well seemingly in lively downward movement.  In reality you are moving upward [¶12]."  What the meditator sees is "a supernatural green light" ringing the mouth of this "dark well."  And this green light is the place "to which descend the Angels and the divine Compassion [¶17]."  The seeker has to ascend through 7 wells, but then, having reached  "the Heaven of the sovereign condition (robubiya)," the soul is rewarded:  "Its atmosphere is a green light . . . through which flow waves eternally in movement towards one another [¶18] [Visio Smaragdina, in Corbin H, 1994]."</p>
                          <h4>"THE CIRCLE OF THE SPECIAL CHERUB" (Germany, 1165-1230).</h4>
                          <p> Jewish Rabbi Eleazar ben Judah of Worms, "The Baal Shem Tov," was a founder of the Jewish Hasidim Ashkenazi.  He advised mystics who practiced kabbalah to lie down as if asleep, to concentrate on the Divine Presence, and to concentrate on a single thought ("When will I be worthy to receive the divine Light?").  Do this, he said, and "Soon the light of your soul blazes forth, and you ascend to the upper universes."  Only the "lower" Shekhinah manifest to humans as visions of colored light.  One of the visions that Eleazor described in more detail was "The Circle of the Special Cherub," which he said looked like the pupil of an eye.</p>
                          <h4> "ENTERING-AS-CIRCULARITY" (Spain, 1165-1240).</h4>
                          <p> When Ibn Al'Arabi could not find an earthly guide to teach him the practice of dhikr ("invocation"), he was rescued by Khidr, "The Green One," celebrated by Sufis as the "Teacher of Prophets."  Al'Arabi described his first vision as "a light which was almost more visible than what was in front of me, except that I had lost all sense of behind.  I no longer had a back or the nape of a neck.  While the vision lasted, I had no sense of direction, as if I had become completely spherical [The Meccan Illuminations II: 486, in Hirtenstein, 1999, pp. 114-116]."  Al'Arabi also said he saw the "cushions of the Litters of the Knowers mentioned in the Quran [55: 76], and I was enveloped by lights until I became wholly light. . . . [Ibid., III: 350, p. 122]."  When asked how he learned these "treasures," he said seeing colored lights gave him "knowledge of 'entering and circularity,' . . . . this circularity is not a matter of not doing, it is actually what is happening. [Ibid., III: 352, pp. 122]."</p>
                          <h4>"THE WHEELS OF THE CHARIOT" (France, ca. 1176?).</h4>
                          <p> The Sepher Bahir ("Book of Brilliance or Illumination") was probably published in Provence in 1176 by an anonymous author who attributed the work to a Rabbi Nehunia ben HaKana who lived in 1st century Palestine. The book describes Sefirot energies that emanate from God, the Unknowable Ein Sof.  Some of the lower-ranking Sefirot can be seen by meditators:  "The first realm is light, and the living light of water.  The second realm is the holy beasts and the wheels of the chariot [Bahir, 126]."  Another translation is more dramatic:  one sees "the flaming eyes of the Chayot, . . . and the wheel-shaped Ofanim, the "winged eyes that glitter with . . . God's presence [Epstein P, 1978]."</p>
                          <h4> "THE WORLD AS A WHEEL" (Flanders, ca. 1200-1268).</h4>
                          <p>In The Book of Life, Beatrice of Nazareth, a Cisterian nun, wrote that her prayers brought visions and ecstasies so strong she was often temporarily paralyzed and out of touch with the world around her, but then sometimes "As soon as she was raised aloft in ecstasy, she saw beneath her feet the whole world as if it were a wheel." </p>
                          <h4>"THE GREEN-LIGHT 'OFFSPRING'" (Spain, ca. 1250-1305.)</h4>
                          <p> In Sefer ba Zohar (The Book of Radiance), Moses de Leon describes the lower Sefirot that can be seen by meditators.  Skilled kabbalists can reach the 3rd Sefirot, called Binah ("The Return" or "The Womb"), in which case they then see visions of "Offspring" Sefirot called Tir'eret ("Beauty and Compassion")—visions of green and purple lights.  The lowest Sefirot in the spiritual hierarchy, the Shekhinah ("Divine Presence"), shines as a blue and black light.  In the Zohar, de Leon advises meditators that "One who enters must enter through this gate [Zohar, 1:7b]."</p>
                          <h4>"ANGEL WHEELS THAT FLY AWAY" (Spain, 1240-1295).</h4>
                          <p> In the book, Somer Mizwah, Rabbi Abraham Abulafia explains that the "bright inner light which shines is a thing without a body, and . . . it is hidden away for the righteous [Idel M, 1988, p. 106]."  To see the lights, meditators focus their attention on the letters of the divine name until the letters ". . . appear as if pure living angels are moving them about and teaching them to man, who turns them about in the form of wheels in the air, flying with their wings, and they are spirit within spirit. . . . And at times the person sees them as if they are resting in the hills and flying away from him [Ibid., p. 101]." </p>
                          <h4>"THE EYE OF A PEACOCK FEATHER" (Tibet, ca. 1350?).</h4>
                          <p> Karma Lingpa, the Tibetan Buddhist lama credited with publishing The Tibetan Book of the Dead, wrote a treatise on meditation, The Natural Liberation of Seeing, in which he told meditators that the first vision to appear is "the mark of absolute space" which is a "halo" of light.  He also explains that "Between your eyebrows there is the 'lamp of the pristine absolute space" which looks like "the colors of the rainbow or like the eye of a peacock feather [Chagmé, 2000]." </p>
                          <h4>"THE EPIPHANY IN GREEN" (Iran, 1392-1464).</h4>
                          <p> The Sufi master who founded the Kubrawiya Order, Muhammed Nurbashkh, a disciple of the Illuminationist Sufi, Najmoddin Kubra, taught disciples to induce a consciousness halfway between waking and sleep, to focus their minds on Allah, and to wait expectantly to "witness an unveiling" in which "brilliant images" would emanate from "higher spheres."  The first of the Unveilings is "an epiphany in green."</p>
                          <h4>"LIKE THE FORM OF A SNAKE" (Spain, 1491-1556).</h4>
                          <p> A Spanish knight named Ignatius Loyola resolved to become a Christian monk while convalescing from severe wounds.  Not knowing how to begin, he moved to a small village, began working as a volunteer in a hospital, and spent most nights in prolonged prayer vigils.  He then began to see visions: "Many times in clear daylight he saw something in the air near him, which gave him much consolation, because it was extremely beautiful.  He did not understand the type of thing it was, but in some ways it appeared to him to have the form of a snake, and it had many things that shone like eyes, although they were not eyes [The Autobiography of St. Ignatius, ¶ 3: 19, translated by Nicholson]."  The "snake" metaphor is consistent with having seen a green, ring-shaped light vision.</p>
                          <h4>"THE SOUL PUTS ON A GREEN ALMILLA" (Spain, 1542-1591).</h4>
                          <p>In his book, Dark Night of the Soul, Juan Yepes, better known as John of the Cross, writes that the soul must wear "garments" as "disguises" to begin the ascent toward God.  The first of these disguises is "a green almilla," a reference to donut-shaped pads knights wore on their shoulders beneath their armor—clearly pointing to rings of green light.  John calls this vision the "emblem of the virtue of Hope," adding that Hope can also be described as a helmet:  "Now a helmet is armor which protects and covers the whole head, and has no opening except in one place, where the eyes may look through.  Hope is such a helmet, for it covers all the senses of the head of the soul in such a way that they cannot be lost in worldly things, and leaves no part of them exposed to the world.  It has one loophole only through which the eyes may look upwards only . . . . [II.21.8]."</p>
                          <h4> "THE UNIVERSE AS A FLOATING BALL" (Algeria, 1869–1934).</h4>
                          <p>Ahmad al-'Alawi, a Sufi mystic in the Sunni branch of Islam, meditated during "the last third of the night," imagining the letters of the Divine Name spreading out until they filled the mind:  "The dhikr would then continue in this form until the letters became like light. . . . the disciple would then find himself able to distinguish between the Absolute and the relative, and he would see the universe as a ball or a lamp suspended in a beginning-less, endless void. . . . [Lings, 1993, pp. 54-55]."  Referring to the Prophet's vision of the Lote Tree, al-'Alawi says that Muhammed saw it with his physical eye but Sufi mystics can only see it with an "inward eye" and accept that they can go no farther:  "Even here is the Garden of Ultimate Refuge, meaning that the Lote Tree marketh a finality of Gnosis, and that he who attaineth unto this point is enshrouded by the Lights of the Divine Presence . . . . This is explained in the words When there enshrouded the Lote Tree That which enshrouded . . . [Lings, 1993, p. 173]."</p>
                          <h4>"A CIRCLE OF LIGHT" (India, 1872 - 1950).</h4>
                          <p>Before he became a famous Hindu guru and founder of the Pondicherry Ashram, Aurobindo Ghose was teaching French at Baroda College when he began to experiment with meditation: ". . . my psychic sight was not yet developed," he would later recall, "I was trying to develop it by dwelling upon the after-image and also by attending to it in the interval between wakefulness and sleep.  Then I saw a circle of light and when I began pranayama, it became very much more intensified." </p>
                          <h4>"CONCENTRIC RINGS" (Arctic Region, 1899-1967).</h4>
                          <p>When a Danish explorer visited the Iglulik Eskimos of Alaska in the 1930's, they told him the prerequisite for being accepted as an authentic shaman was an ability to see visions of an inner light (angákoq), "a mysterious light which the shaman suddenly feels in his body, inside his head, within the brain, an inexplicable searchlight, a luminous fire, which enables him to see in the dark, both literally and metaphorically speaking, . . . [Rasmussen, 1930, p. 111]."  Another explorer reported that the shaman often "gets his visions sitting or lying in deep concentration at the back of the sleeping platform, behind a curtain or covered with a skin.  The drum is not used in this connection [Holtved, 1967, p. 47]."  Shamans often adorn their ritual costumes with images depicting their spirit visions:  an Eskimo shaman in Siberia carved a face mask with one central peep-hole surrounded by concentric rings [Nelson, 1899, in Benson and Sehgal, 1987, p. 8], and the ceremonial clothing of another Siberian shaman had concentric circles on the front of the shirt and on the leggings [Vastckas, 1977, see Ibid., p. 6]. </p>
                          <h4>"THE EYE OF A PEACOCK FEATHER" (Columbia, ca. 1975).</h4>
                          <p> An anthropologist working with the Tukano Indians of Amazonia tried the hallucinogenic drug, ayahuasca (yajé), that the Tukanos use in tribal rituals.  His tapes record him saying: "I'm seeing something . . . well, like . . . it's dark, but I see something like the tail of a peacock…but at the same time it's like…everything in movement…like fireworks, no? [Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1975, p.164]."  That the Tukanos see similar light-rings is evident from two observations:   the shamans trace concentric rings in the sand to illustrate the "bogá" energies from a "hidden sun," and images of concentric rings line the upper walls of ceremonial longhouses. </p>
                          <h4>"THE LIGHT OF YOUNG COCA LEAVES" (Columbia, ca. 1975).</h4>
                          <p> Near the end of the Tukano ayahuasca ceremony, when the chaotic, hallucinogenic images have disappeared, a third stage of the ritual begins.  Tranquility is restored, and now the Tukano celebrants begin to see visions that they describe as "yellowish-green light like young coca leaves, the light of paradise [Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1975, p. 172]." </p>
                          <h4>"THE EYE OF A PEACOCK FEATHER" (China, 2004).</h4>
                          <p> While attending a conference on shamanism in Changchun in 2004, the author saw Manchu shamans perform traditional dances.  Their headdresses were rimmed with peacock feathers and beads hung down to cover the dancers' eyes.  This combination symbolizes what shamans see when they withdraw attention from the world around them and redirect it inward to the world of spirits where they see visions of light, including the "eye" of green rings surrounding dark blue disks.</p>

                            A SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE</h3>
                          <p style="text-align:center">(c) 2011 Philip T. Nicholson</p>
                          <h4>1.  ARE THESE VIDEO ANIMATIONS ACCURATE?</h4>
                          <p><span style="padding:0px;">AMORPHOUS MISTS:</span> The accuracy is only about 50%.  In actual experience, the ever-changing mists occupy a much smaller space, so they look more like "clouds," "bubbles," or the Northern Lights.</p>

                          <h4>2. WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE THE BRAIN?</h4>
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <span>THE ONSET OF SLEEP RHYTHMS</span><br>
                          <br>
                          <p>When a person is awake, the brain receives a stream of incoming signals from the sensory receptors—from the eyes, the ears, the mouth, the skin—but when a person begins the transition to sleep, the brain begins to dampen down the volume of incoming signals and substitute patterns of neuron discharges that it generates on its own.  These sleep-related brain waves are responsible for generating the visions of light shown in this first video.<br>
                            <br>
                            It is important to point out that if a person believes that these visions are initiated by God, as many do believe, then the analysis that appears below still applies.  Why is this so?  Because in order for the same light visions to appear in the visual field, the same brain structures would have to be activated, but these brain processes could well have been initiated by God.  God would naturally make use of the structures of the human brain to deliver messages in a manner that could be perceived by humans.</p>
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <span>GREEN MISTS & CORTICAL SLOW WAVES</span><br>
                          <br>
                          <p>The visions of amorphous green mists are generated by "cortical slow waves," the first of two sleep-related brain waves.  During the transition to sleep, as a person becomes drowsy and starts to withdraw attention from the outside world, neurons in the outer shell of the brain—the cortex—begin to discharge spontaneously in small outbursts. These small groups of discharges break out in random locations and generate waves that spread outward in unpredictable directions but then quickly disappear.  This produces a slow, synchronous beat, the "cortical slow wave," called "slow" because these waves recur at a rate of less than one per second—in technical jargon, at a rate of less than 1 Hertz ( < 1 Hz).  This drowsy state is considered "stage 1" of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS).</p>
                          <p>The pulse of the cortical slow wave pulls a person's consciousness ever further away from the outside world and any remaining sensory signals.  It also affects neurons in the thalamus, the brain's "relay station," by changing the cells' electrical environment—in technical jargon, by decreasing thalamic cell membrane polarization.  This drop in electrical potential triggers a shift to stage 2 NREMS when a new and very different kind of brain wave becomes active, a wave that usually pushes a person into the first deep sleep. </p>
                          <br>
                          <br>
                          <span>SHRINKING RINGS & SYNCHRONOUS SLEEP SPINDLES</span><br>
                          <br>
                          <p>The visions of the shrinking green rings are generated by the onset of strong, synchronous brain pulses called "sleep spindles" that occur at regular intervals of one burst every 3 to 10 seconds (0.2 Hz).  These waves are called "spindles" because when recorded in an EEG the pen tracings get bigger and bigger and then begin to drop off, creating a pattern that resembles a spindle of yarn.  When the brain is generating its own rhythmic waves in rapid succession, these internally-generated pulsations block the transmission of sensory signals from the outside world into those parts of the brain that have to process them before they can appear in consciousness.  This is why a person typically loses consciousness at the moment of sleep onset which is when the spindle waves begin.  To use a metaphor from the world of sound, synchronous spindle waves are like loud drumbeats that drown out all other sounds.  The onset of synchronous spindle waves is called "stage 2" of NREMS.</p>
                          <p>If people usually lose consciousness when the spindle waves begin, then how is it possible for meditators to actually see light-rings generated by spindles?  Why don't meditators also lose consciousness?  The answer is strange but quite fascinating:  if meditators close their eyes and then move them in a certain manner (e.g., rolling them upward, or converging them inward, or both) and if at the same time they focus their attention on the dark empty space in front of them, then the visual parts of the brain are so strongly stimulated that they keep active—that is, they keep "awake"—even while other parts of the body are falling asleep.  As a result, when the spindle waves reach the visual pathways, they are unable to overwhelm the visual neurons, as they have done elsewhere in the body, so the visual neurons react to the receipt of spindle waves as if these waves were visual signals from the outside world:  the person sees a vision of internally-generated light ("phosphene") that acquires its shape, color, and direction of movement from the neuron circuits that originally generated the spindle waves. </p>
                          <p>A meditator usually sees anywhere from 3 to 6 rings light-rings—each person sees a characteristic number of rings—and then the ring visions stop automatically.  This makes way for the next set of visions in the meditation-induced progression—the visions of blue or purple "clouds" depicted in Video 2.</p>
                          <h4>WHY DOES THE GREEN FILL-DISK CHANGE TO BLUE?</h4>
                          <p>When the same groups of neurons are frequently stimulated to discharge at the same time, the connections between those neurons are strengthened.  Those neurons-assemblies become more sensitive to the type of signal that causes them to discharge, or, put another way, their firing threshold is lowered.  This is the process behind all learning; it's the process that explains why throwing a ball again and again using the same muscles eventually instills a "muscle memory," so that the skill can be exercised automatically.<br>
                            <br>
                            Similarly, if a meditators frequently induce light visions (as prescribed in some types of meditation practice), and, to more specifically, if the meditators induce the visions of shrinking light-rings, then over time the firing threshold of those neurons in the visual pathways that participate in processing the ring-related signals will gradually be lowered.  When the firing thresholds of blue-processing neurons become lower and lower as ring visions keep getting induced, a threshold is reached at which time the blue-processing neurons begin to discharge even though previously they would have required higher levels of stimulation.  These neurons now respond to a relatively weak signal that they would previously have ignored.  From that moment on, the blue-processing neurons contribute signals to the composition of the color pattern.  The distribution of blue-processing neurons is such that the change from green to blue light only occurs in the fill-disk, not in the ring itself. </p>

                          <h3>MYSTICS' DESCRIPTIONS OF GREEN VISIONS</h3>
                          <i>(c) 2011 Philip T. Nicholson</i>
                          <p>This list contains 41 entries encompassing
                            the world's major religous traditions</p>
                          <h4>"THE WATERHOLE THAT LEADS TO DREAMTIME"(Australia, ca. 50,000 BCE).</h4>
                          <p>To guide their meditations, the Aborigine "Men of High Degree" create an image consisting of 3 to 6 concentric rings, a symbol of the "energy centers" called "sacred waterholes."  These waterholes are the portals that allow spirits and humans to move between the Dreamtime and ordinary reality.  The symbol of 3 to 6 concentric circles represents the vision of 3 to 6 green light-rings that the "Men of High Degree" see as they enter the Dreamtime.</p>
                          <h4>"THE RAINBOW SERPENT"(Australia, ca. 50,000 BCE).</h4>
                          <p> This ancient ancestral spirit of the Aborigines can manifest in 2 ways:  it can appear in the sky (as a "Day-Crawler") or in the Dreamtime (as an "Eye-Thing)."  In the Dreamtime, the body of the spirit glows with green, blue, or purple lights that can be seen by "Men of High Degree" who are seeking power.  The "fire" colors of yellow, orange, and red which are burning the back of the "Day-Crawler" are extinguished when the Serpent dives into the Dreamtime through a "sacred waterhole".</p>
                          <h4>"THE EYE OF HORUS"(Egypt, ca. 2500 BCE).</h4>
                          <p>A green oval line was painted on the foreheads of mummies as priests chanted to summon the dissembodied "Eye of Horus," the Falcon God, also called "The Green One," to come carry the kings' souls into the Underworld.  The priests believed this because they'd seen "receding" green light-rings when they put on "garments of light" to enter the Underworld themselves.  The priests also said the skin of the gods was green.</p>
                          <h4>"THE RADIANT WHEELS"(India, ca. 1500 BCE).</h4>
                          <p> In the hymns of the Rig Veda, Indo-Aryan priests describe the auspicious vision of a chariot consisting of 3 "radiant wheels" where the "rims of the wheels are bent by the minds of the priests."  The radiant wheels "fly away from the viewer, . . . with no horses attached." One verse says the wheels are "verdant" in color.</p>
                          <h4>"THE LIMITED-LIGHT VISIONS OF THE BUDDHAS"(India, 563-483 BCE).</h4>
                          <p> While Gotama the Buddha meditated all night beneath a Banyan tree, he saw "limited light-manifestations" until suddenly, just before dawn, the "Divine Eye opened" (caksus uppada), flooding his mind with a "boundless light-manifestation."  Gotama does not describe the "limited-lights," but religious artwork created by his followers in the temples of the Silk Road and China almost always show the "Enlightened Ones" floating amid celestial mists of green (or dark blue) or wearing robes with prominent flares of green (or dark blue).</p>
                          <h4>"WHEELS WITHIN WHEELS" (Babylon, ca. 500 BCE).</h4>
                          <p> Ezekiel, a Hebrew priest in exile, saw a vision that included 4 wheels, "beryl" in color (aquamarine or emerald), "their construction being something like a wheel within a wheel."  The wheels moved in a straight line "without veering" when he turned his head.  Ezekiel also said he saw a vision of "splendor all around" that shone with the colors of a rainbow.</p>
                          <h4> "THE CIRCLING YANG ENERGY"(China, ca. 32 BCE).</h4>
                          <p> The Daoist "Celestial Master" Zhang Ling's The Scripture of Great Peace advises seekers to "Guard the Light of the One" (Shou-i) by sitting quietly with eyes closed until "a brilliant light" arises: "The splendor of Yang starts to shine and spreads it light . . . Its chi [energy] turns and circles like the wheels of a chariot."</p>
                          <h4>"K'AWIL'S VISION SERPENT"(Mesoamerica, ca. 250-1200 CE).</h4>
                          <p> K'awil, Mayan god of life-force and transitional states, uses the gullet of his spirit companion (uay), K'ukumatz, the feathered "Vision Serpent," as the conduit for sending the spirits of dead notables up to the Milky Way or back to earth.  The serpent's feathers are iridescent green and blue—the colors of the quetzal bird.  The Aztecs adopted the Mayan myth and called their Plumed Serpent, Quetzalcoatl.</p>
                          <h4>"PRECIOUS-BLUE-GREEN-LIGHTNING" (Mesoamerica, ca. 250-1200).</h4>
                          <p> Jurakán, Mayan god of thunderstorms and lightning, manifests in 3 guises:  as lightning-bolts, as flashes of sheet lightning, or as Räxa-lightning.  Räxa can mean "green," "blue," or "precious" lightning.  A symbol associated with Jurakán is a flint axehead implanted in the forehead of a god or a vision serpent or a Mayan king in the process of being transformed into a god.  The axehead smokes, which points to a fire-in-the-mind's eye, which would explain why the Mayans spoke of a "precious" lightning that can be either blue or green.</p>
                          <h4> "YELLOW COURT OF THE HEART" (China, ca. 300 CE).</h4>
                          <p> The Book of Great Profundity (Ta-tung iing), an important text for "Highest Purity" Daoists, says the first spirits to appear in the meditator's "Yellow Court of the Heart" are yellowish-green lights, a mix of green "energy" (chi) from the "Original Father" in the head and yellow "energy" from the "Original Mother" at the base of the trunk.</p>
                          <h4>"ORBED PHOSPHORS" (China, ca. 330 CE).</h4>
                          <p> Daoist Master Yang Xi, author of another important "Highest Purity" treatise, The Upper Scripture of Purple Texts, advised those who wanted to be "Perfected Beings" to use the technique of "visualization" (cunjian) and picture colored lights circulating through the body.  Eventually the gods will take pity and send down their celestial lights, "the Cloudsouls of the Sun," lights that flow spontaneously.  Among these celestial lights are visions of "Orbed Phosphors" and "Green (Rainbow) Glare."</p>
                          <h4>"GIRDLES OF JADE" (China, ca. 330).</h4>
                          <p> In yet another treatise of the "Highest Purity" school of Daoism, meditators are advised to "visualize the energy of the Jade Girdle descending from the Nine Heavens and encircling the body."  Jade is often green, and green light-rings sweep in from all sides as if "encircling" the body.</p>
                          <h4>"EYES OF THE CHERUBIM" (Syria, 6th C.).</h4>
                          <p> Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, an anonymous Christian mystic, writes in The Divine Names that "The Good is described as the light of the mind . . . . At first it deals out the light in small amounts and then, as the wish and the longing for light begins to grow, it gives more and more of itself."  In The Celestial Hierarchy, he says that "where there is no intermediary between the mystic and God" there is a light like "the most holy 'thrones' and orders said to possess many eyes and many wings, called in Hebrew the 'cherubim' and 'seraphim'."</p>
                          <h4>"WHIRLING FIREBRANDS" (Ceylon, ca. 5th C.).</h4>
                          <p> Buddhaghosa, in his Pali text, Visshuddhimagga, "Path of Purification," one of the foundations of the Theravadin school of Buddhism, says light visions ("illuminations") are a "beginner's samadhi" that distracts meditators from the True Path.  He points to the illusory nature of these visions:  "formations appear to him as perpetually renewed;"  "they are also short-lived like dew-drops at sunrise . . . like a bubble on water;" "And they appear without core, like a conjuring trick . . . like a mirage . . . like the circle of a whirling firebrand [20: 104]."</p>
                          <h4>"A LOTUS TREE, ENSHROUDED" (Arabian Peninsula, 610).</h4>
                          <p> "My eyes sleep but my heart is awake," said the Prophet Muhammed when asked how he prayed.  It was while he on retreat and praying in a cave that he saw "the Signs of my Lord" [Quran 53: 1-12] far away on a clear horizon.  When the "Signs" reappeared a second time, they'd moved to "within the shot of a bow" and were situated "near the Lotus Tree that marks the boundary of the Garden of the Abode."  Beyond this boundary, Allah dwells unseen by humans.  A lotus tree has a bower of leaves that form a green disk.  Muhammed's vision of the Lotus Tree was "enshrouded in what it was enshrouded." Later he would explain that "It was covered in colours, I do not know what they are . . . . [Hadith, al-Bukhaari]."</p>
                          <h4>"THE GREEN CUSHIONS OF PARADISE" (Arabian Peninsula, 610).</h4>
                          <p> The Prophet Muhammed also saw visions of the "green rafraf of the believers living in Paradise [Quran 55: 76]."  The Arabic word, rafraf, means "litters" or "cushions."  Many Sufi mystics who see visions refer to this passage in the Quran.</p>
                          <h4>"TUBA TREE NUT CASINGS" (Arabian Peninsula, 610).</h4>
                          <p> On another occasion, the Prophet Muhammed saw a vision of a giant Tuba Tree in Paradise, and he said the dwellers in Paradise used the outer casings surrounding the nuts of this giant Tuba Tree to make their clothes.  The casings that enclose ordinary tuba tree nuts are green spheres that look like big green grapes.</p>
                          <h4>"THE GREEN HEART-CHAKRA" (India, 950-1020).</h4>
                          <p> The Hindu guru, Abhinavagupta, author of the Tantraloka ("Light of Tantra"), says the first vision seen by skilled meditators will be the green light emanating from the "heart chakra."  This word, chakra, refers to a hierarchy of "subtle energy centers" aligned with the human body and also to the type of light emitted by each center.  When a "subtle" spiritual energy called kundalini rises up through the chakras, it releases a specific color of light. </p>
                          <h4>"A CIRCULAR MIST" (Greece, 949-1022).</h4>
                          <p>In Hymns of Divine Love, Symeon the New Theologian, a Christian monk who lived in Byzantine Greece, describes his first vision: "Suddenly a flood of divine radiance descended like a bright cloud of mist" that "seemed to surround my head entirely," and then the mist moved "into the center of my heart" where it "appeared like a sun, round as a circle." </p>
                          <h4>"4 WHEELS LIKE UMBRELLAS" (India, 956-1041).</h4>
                          <p>In his influential anthology entitled The Epitome of the Six Yogas, a Tantric Buddhist teacher named Naropa summarized the most effective meditation practices for attaining Enlightenment in a single lifetime, called "Highest Yoga Tantra" (maha-anuttara-yoga.)  In one chapter, "The Yoga of Psychic Heat," Naropa advised meditators to remember an old saying: "Meditate on 4 wheels, each like an umbrella."  Light-wheels like umbrellas because the rims shrink in diameter like the rims of umbrellas collapsed by their owners.  Naropa also says the first signs of spiritual progress are "phenomena appearing like smoke, mirage, and fireflies," and a sensation of inner heat (phumo).</p>
                          <h4>"THE HALO OF 5 LIGHTS" (Tibet, 1012-1097).</h4>
                          <p>Marpa Lotsawa, a Buddhist monk from Tibet, studied with Naropa, translated The Six Yogas into the Tibetan language, and brought that book  back with him when he returned to his native land.  In his book, Elucidation of the Summary of the Five Stages, Marpa advised meditators that when they see lights begin to flow spontaneously, "First one experiences the hallucination-like sign that arises with the halo of five lights."</p>
                          <h4>"THE RAINBOW VAJRA-BODY" (Tibet, 1052-1135).</h4>
                          <p> Jetsun Milarepa, a disciple of Marpa the Translator, lived for years as a solitary hermit practicing severe austerities—not wearing clothes during cold Tibetan winters, not eating for days, or eating nettles. Milarepa told his followers that he saw his true self in his mind's eye as a "rainbow vajra-body."  The word, "vajra," means "lightning," so his true body appeared as a series of lights with rainbow colors.  He also said his "real form" was a "green light," not his physical body.</p>
                          <h4>"THE COSMIC WHEELS" (Germany, 1098-1179).</h4>
                          <p> The Christian nun and abbotess, Hildegard of Bingen, saw visions of a white light that appeared spontaneously, but she also saw visions of a different type of vision that appeared while she was deep in prayer.  She illustrated what she'd seen by making paintings, and in these works Hildegard returns again and again to a distinctive image in which rings of light are prominently displayed.  She paints these rings with blues and grays rather than greens, but the shape is unmistakeable.  Examples include the paintings called "The Man in Sapphire Blue," "Egg of the Universe," and "The Cosmic Wheel." </p>
                          <h4>"A PEARL GLOWS ON MT. QAF" (Iran, 1152-1191).</h4>
                          <p> In The Red Intellect, Yahya Suhrawardi, founder of the Sufi Order of "Illuminationists," placed special emphasis on seeing visions of colored light.  He advised meditators to trust Khidr, "The Green One," known to Sufis as the "Teacher of Prophets," to guide them forward. He also told them to watch for the vision of "The Pearl-that-glows-by-night-on-Mount Qaf."  This "Pearl" is a vision of green light that is reflected off the green bowers of the Tuba Tree Muhammed saw in Paradise.  The vision begins in blackness, but then the meditator sees a green "Pearl" that is moving away, accumulating more light as it moves, and then, when it reaches it farthest extent, it captures the full image of the Tuba Tree, becoming a sphere of green light.</p>
                          <h4>"THE SHRINKING WELL" (Iran, 1145-1220).</h4>
                          <p> In his book, Visio Smaragdina, the Iranian Sufi Illuminationist, Najmoddin Kubra, advises meditators that they will feel as if they are falling down into a deep, dark well when actually their spirits are moving upward:  "It may happen that you visualize yourself as lying at the bottom of a well and the well seemingly in lively downward movement.  In reality you are moving upward [¶12]."  What the meditator sees is "a supernatural green light" ringing the mouth of this "dark well."  And this green light is the place "to which descend the Angels and the divine Compassion [¶17]."  The seeker has to ascend through 7 wells, but then, having reached  "the Heaven of the sovereign condition (robubiya)," the soul is rewarded:  "Its atmosphere is a green light . . . through which flow waves eternally in movement towards one another [¶18] [Visio Smaragdina, in Corbin H, 1994]."</p>
                          <h4>"THE CIRCLE OF THE SPECIAL CHERUB" (Germany, 1165-1230).</h4>
                          <p> Jewish Rabbi Eleazar ben Judah of Worms, "The Baal Shem Tov," was a founder of the Jewish Hasidim Ashkenazi.  He advised mystics who practiced kabbalah to lie down as if asleep, to concentrate on the Divine Presence, and to concentrate on a single thought ("When will I be worthy to receive the divine Light?").  Do this, he said, and "Soon the light of your soul blazes forth, and you ascend to the upper universes."  Only the "lower" Shekhinah manifest to humans as visions of colored light.  One of the visions that Eleazor described in more detail was "The Circle of the Special Cherub," which he said looked like the pupil of an eye.</p>
                          <h4> "ENTERING-AS-CIRCULARITY" (Spain, 1165-1240).</h4>
                          <p> When Ibn Al'Arabi could not find an earthly guide to teach him the practice of dhikr ("invocation"), he was rescued by Khidr, "The Green One," celebrated by Sufis as the "Teacher of Prophets."  Al'Arabi described his first vision as "a light which was almost more visible than what was in front of me, except that I had lost all sense of behind.  I no longer had a back or the nape of a neck.  While the vision lasted, I had no sense of direction, as if I had become completely spherical [The Meccan Illuminations II: 486, in Hirtenstein, 1999, pp. 114-116]."  Al'Arabi also said he saw the "cushions of the Litters of the Knowers mentioned in the Quran [55: 76], and I was enveloped by lights until I became wholly light. . . . [Ibid., III: 350, p. 122]."  When asked how he learned these "treasures," he said seeing colored lights gave him "knowledge of 'entering and circularity,' . . . . this circularity is not a matter of not doing, it is actually what is happening. [Ibid., III: 352, pp. 122]."</p>
                          <h4>"THE WHEELS OF THE CHARIOT" (France, ca. 1176?).</h4>
                          <p> The Sepher Bahir ("Book of Brilliance or Illumination") was probably published in Provence in 1176 by an anonymous author who attributed the work to a Rabbi Nehunia ben HaKana who lived in 1st century Palestine. The book describes Sefirot energies that emanate from God, the Unknowable Ein Sof.  Some of the lower-ranking Sefirot can be seen by meditators:  "The first realm is light, and the living light of water.  The second realm is the holy beasts and the wheels of the chariot [Bahir, 126]."  Another translation is more dramatic:  one sees "the flaming eyes of the Chayot, . . . and the wheel-shaped Ofanim, the "winged eyes that glitter with . . . God's presence [Epstein P, 1978]."</p>
                          <h4> "THE WORLD AS A WHEEL" (Flanders, ca. 1200-1268).</h4>
                          <p>In The Book of Life, Beatrice of Nazareth, a Cisterian nun, wrote that her prayers brought visions and ecstasies so strong she was often temporarily paralyzed and out of touch with the world around her, but then sometimes "As soon as she was raised aloft in ecstasy, she saw beneath her feet the whole world as if it were a wheel." </p>
                          <h4>"THE GREEN-LIGHT 'OFFSPRING'" (Spain, ca. 1250-1305.)</h4>
                          <p> In Sefer ba Zohar (The Book of Radiance), Moses de Leon describes the lower Sefirot that can be seen by meditators.  Skilled kabbalists can reach the 3rd Sefirot, called Binah ("The Return" or "The Womb"), in which case they then see visions of "Offspring" Sefirot called Tir'eret ("Beauty and Compassion")—visions of green and purple lights.  The lowest Sefirot in the spiritual hierarchy, the Shekhinah ("Divine Presence"), shines as a blue and black light.  In the Zohar, de Leon advises meditators that "One who enters must enter through this gate [Zohar, 1:7b]."</p>
                          <h4>"ANGEL WHEELS THAT FLY AWAY" (Spain, 1240-1295).</h4>
                          <p> In the book, Somer Mizwah, Rabbi Abraham Abulafia explains that the "bright inner light which shines is a thing without a body, and . . . it is hidden away for the righteous [Idel M, 1988, p. 106]."  To see the lights, meditators focus their attention on the letters of the divine name until the letters ". . . appear as if pure living angels are moving them about and teaching them to man, who turns them about in the form of wheels in the air, flying with their wings, and they are spirit within spirit. . . . And at times the person sees them as if they are resting in the hills and flying away from him [Ibid., p. 101]." </p>
                          <h4>"THE EYE OF A PEACOCK FEATHER" (Tibet, ca. 1350?).</h4>
                          <p> Karma Lingpa, the Tibetan Buddhist lama credited with publishing The Tibetan Book of the Dead, wrote a treatise on meditation, The Natural Liberation of Seeing, in which he told meditators that the first vision to appear is "the mark of absolute space" which is a "halo" of light.  He also explains that "Between your eyebrows there is the 'lamp of the pristine absolute space" which looks like "the colors of the rainbow or like the eye of a peacock feather [Chagmé, 2000]." </p>
                          <h4>"THE EPIPHANY IN GREEN" (Iran, 1392-1464).</h4>
                          <p> The Sufi master who founded the Kubrawiya Order, Muhammed Nurbashkh, a disciple of the Illuminationist Sufi, Najmoddin Kubra, taught disciples to induce a consciousness halfway between waking and sleep, to focus their minds on Allah, and to wait expectantly to "witness an unveiling" in which "brilliant images" would emanate from "higher spheres."  The first of the Unveilings is "an epiphany in green."</p>
                          <h4>"LIKE THE FORM OF A SNAKE" (Spain, 1491-1556).</h4>
                          <p> A Spanish knight named Ignatius Loyola resolved to become a Christian monk while convalescing from severe wounds.  Not knowing how to begin, he moved to a small village, began working as a volunteer in a hospital, and spent most nights in prolonged prayer vigils.  He then began to see visions: "Many times in clear daylight he saw something in the air near him, which gave him much consolation, because it was extremely beautiful.  He did not understand the type of thing it was, but in some ways it appeared to him to have the form of a snake, and it had many things that shone like eyes, although they were not eyes [The Autobiography of St. Ignatius, ¶ 3: 19, translated by Nicholson]."  The "snake" metaphor is consistent with having seen a green, ring-shaped light vision.</p>
                          <h4>"THE SOUL PUTS ON A GREEN ALMILLA" (Spain, 1542-1591).</h4>
                          <p>In his book, Dark Night of the Soul, Juan Yepes, better known as John of the Cross, writes that the soul must wear "garments" as "disguises" to begin the ascent toward God.  The first of these disguises is "a green almilla," a reference to donut-shaped pads knights wore on their shoulders beneath their armor—clearly pointing to rings of green light.  John calls this vision the "emblem of the virtue of Hope," adding that Hope can also be described as a helmet:  "Now a helmet is armor which protects and covers the whole head, and has no opening except in one place, where the eyes may look through.  Hope is such a helmet, for it covers all the senses of the head of the soul in such a way that they cannot be lost in worldly things, and leaves no part of them exposed to the world.  It has one loophole only through which the eyes may look upwards only . . . . [II.21.8]."</p>
                          <h4> "THE UNIVERSE AS A FLOATING BALL" (Algeria, 1869–1934).</h4>
                          <p>Ahmad al-'Alawi, a Sufi mystic in the Sunni branch of Islam, meditated during "the last third of the night," imagining the letters of the Divine Name spreading out until they filled the mind:  "The dhikr would then continue in this form until the letters became like light. . . . the disciple would then find himself able to distinguish between the Absolute and the relative, and he would see the universe as a ball or a lamp suspended in a beginning-less, endless void. . . . [Lings, 1993, pp. 54-55]."  Referring to the Prophet's vision of the Lote Tree, al-'Alawi says that Muhammed saw it with his physical eye but Sufi mystics can only see it with an "inward eye" and accept that they can go no farther:  "Even here is the Garden of Ultimate Refuge, meaning that the Lote Tree marketh a finality of Gnosis, and that he who attaineth unto this point is enshrouded by the Lights of the Divine Presence . . . . This is explained in the words When there enshrouded the Lote Tree That which enshrouded . . . [Lings, 1993, p. 173]."</p>
                          <h4>"A CIRCLE OF LIGHT" (India, 1872 - 1950).</h4>
                          <p>Before he became a famous Hindu guru and founder of the Pondicherry Ashram, Aurobindo Ghose was teaching French at Baroda College when he began to experiment with meditation: ". . . my psychic sight was not yet developed," he would later recall, "I was trying to develop it by dwelling upon the after-image and also by attending to it in the interval between wakefulness and sleep.  Then I saw a circle of light and when I began pranayama, it became very much more intensified." </p>
                          <h4>"CONCENTRIC RINGS" (Arctic Region, 1899-1967).</h4>
                          <p>When a Danish explorer visited the Iglulik Eskimos of Alaska in the 1930's, they told him the prerequisite for being accepted as an authentic shaman was an ability to see visions of an inner light (angákoq), "a mysterious light which the shaman suddenly feels in his body, inside his head, within the brain, an inexplicable searchlight, a luminous fire, which enables him to see in the dark, both literally and metaphorically speaking, . . . [Rasmussen, 1930, p. 111]."  Another explorer reported that the shaman often "gets his visions sitting or lying in deep concentration at the back of the sleeping platform, behind a curtain or covered with a skin.  The drum is not used in this connection [Holtved, 1967, p. 47]."  Shamans often adorn their ritual costumes with images depicting their spirit visions:  an Eskimo shaman in Siberia carved a face mask with one central peep-hole surrounded by concentric rings [Nelson, 1899, in Benson and Sehgal, 1987, p. 8], and the ceremonial clothing of another Siberian shaman had concentric circles on the front of the shirt and on the leggings [Vastckas, 1977, see Ibid., p. 6]. </p>
                          <h4>"THE EYE OF A PEACOCK FEATHER" (Columbia, ca. 1975).</h4>
                          <p> An anthropologist working with the Tukano Indians of Amazonia tried the hallucinogenic drug, ayahuasca (yajé), that the Tukanos use in tribal rituals.  His tapes record him saying: "I'm seeing something . . . well, like . . . it's dark, but I see something like the tail of a peacock…but at the same time it's like…everything in movement…like fireworks, no? [Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1975, p.164]."  That the Tukanos see similar light-rings is evident from two observations:   the shamans trace concentric rings in the sand to illustrate the "bogá" energies from a "hidden sun," and images of concentric rings line the upper walls of ceremonial longhouses. </p>
                          <h4>"THE LIGHT OF YOUNG COCA LEAVES" (Columbia, ca. 1975).</h4>
                          <p> Near the end of the Tukano ayahuasca ceremony, when the chaotic, hallucinogenic images have disappeared, a third stage of the ritual begins.  Tranquility is restored, and now the Tukano celebrants begin to see visions that they describe as "yellowish-green light like young coca leaves, the light of paradise [Reichel-Dolmatoff, 1975, p. 172]." </p>
                          <h4>"THE EYE OF A PEACOCK FEATHER" (China, 2004).</h4>
                          <p> While attending a conference on shamanism in Changchun in 2004, the author saw Manchu shamans perform traditional dances.  Their headdresses were rimmed with peacock feathers and beads hung down to cover the dancers' eyes.  This combination symbolizes what shamans see when they withdraw attention from the world around them and redirect it inward to the world of spirits where they see visions of light, including the "eye" of green rings surrounding dark blue disks.</p>

                            A SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE</h3>
                          <p style="text-align:center">(c) 2011 Philip T. Nicholson</p>
                          <h4>1.  ARE THESE VIDEO ANIMATIONS ACCURATE?</h4>
                          <p style="margin:10px 20px"><span>AMORPHOUS MISTS:</span> The accuracy is only about 50%.  In actual experience, the ever-changing mists occupy a much smaller space, so they look more like "clouds," "bubbles," or the Northern Lights.</p>

                          <h4>2. WHAT'S HAPPENING INSIDE THE BRAIN?</h4>
                          <span>THE ONSET OF SLEEP RHYTHMS</span>
                          <p>When a person is awake, the brain receives a stream of incoming signals from the sensory receptors—from the eyes, the ears, the mouth, the skin—but when a person begins the transition to sleep, the brain begins to dampen down the volume of incoming signals and substitute patterns of neuron discharges that it generates on its own.  These sleep-related brain waves are responsible for generating the visions of light shown in this first video.<br>
                            <br>
                            It is important to point out that if a person believes that these visions are initiated by God, as many do believe, then the analysis that appears below still applies.  Why is this so?  Because in order for the same light visions to appear in the visual field, the same brain structures would have to be activated, but these brain processes could well have been initiated by God.  God would naturally make use of the structures of the human brain to deliver messages in a manner that could be perceived by humans.</p>
                          <span>GREEN MISTS & CORTICAL SLOW WAVES</span><br>
                          <br>
                          <p>The visions of amorphous green mists are generated by "cortical slow waves," the first of two sleep-related brain waves.  During the transition to sleep, as a person becomes drowsy and starts to withdraw attention from the outside world, neurons in the outer shell of the brain—the cortex—begin to discharge spontaneously in small outbursts. These small groups of discharges break out in random locations and generate waves that spread outward in unpredictable directions but then quickly disappear.  This produces a slow, synchronous beat, the "cortical slow wave," called "slow" because these waves recur at a rate of less than one per second—in technical jargon, at a rate of less than 1 Hertz ( < 1 Hz).  This drowsy state is considered "stage 1" of non-rapid-eye-movement sleep (NREMS).</p>
                          <p>The pulse of the cortical slow wave pulls a person's consciousness ever further away from the outside world and any remaining sensory signals.  It also affects neurons in the thalamus, the brain's "relay station," by changing the cells' electrical environment—in technical jargon, by decreasing thalamic cell membrane polarization.  This drop in electrical potential triggers a shift to stage 2 NREMS when a new and very different kind of brain wave becomes active, a wave that usually pushes a person into the first deep sleep. </p>
                          <span>SHRINKING RINGS & SYNCHRONOUS SLEEP SPINDLES</span><br>
                          <p>The visions of the shrinking green rings are generated by the onset of strong, synchronous brain pulses called "sleep spindles" that occur at regular intervals of one burst every 3 to 10 seconds (0.2 Hz).  These waves are called "spindles" because when recorded in an EEG the pen tracings get bigger and bigger and then begin to drop off, creating a pattern that resembles a spindle of yarn.  When the brain is generating its own rhythmic waves in rapid succession, these internally-generated pulsations block the transmission of sensory signals from the outside world into those parts of the brain that have to process them before they can appear in consciousness.  This is why a person typically loses consciousness at the moment of sleep onset which is when the spindle waves begin.  To use a metaphor from the world of sound, synchronous spindle waves are like loud drumbeats that drown out all other sounds.  The onset of synchronous spindle waves is called "stage 2" of NREMS.</p>
                          <p>If people usually lose consciousness when the spindle waves begin, then how is it possible for meditators to actually see light-rings generated by spindles?  Why don't meditators also lose consciousness?  The answer is strange but quite fascinating:  if meditators close their eyes and then move them in a certain manner (e.g., rolling them upward, or converging them inward, or both) and if at the same time they focus their attention on the dark empty space in front of them, then the visual parts of the brain are so strongly stimulated that they keep active—that is, they keep "awake"—even while other parts of the body are falling asleep.  As a result, when the spindle waves reach the visual pathways, they are unable to overwhelm the visual neurons, as they have done elsewhere in the body, so the visual neurons react to the receipt of spindle waves as if these waves were visual signals from the outside world:  the person sees a vision of internally-generated light ("phosphene") that acquires its shape, color, and direction of movement from the neuron circuits that originally generated the spindle waves. </p>
                          <p>A meditator usually sees anywhere from 3 to 6 rings light-rings—each person sees a characteristic number of rings—and then the ring visions stop automatically.  This makes way for the next set of visions in the meditation-induced progression—the visions of blue or purple "clouds" depicted in Video 2.</p>
                          <h4>WHY DOES THE GREEN FILL-DISK CHANGE TO BLUE?</h4>
                          <p>When the same groups of neurons are frequently stimulated to discharge at the same time, the connections between those neurons are strengthened.  Those neurons-assemblies become more sensitive to the type of signal that causes them to discharge, or, put another way, their firing threshold is lowered.  This is the process behind all learning; it's the process that explains why throwing a ball again and again using the same muscles eventually instills a "muscle memory," so that the skill can be exercised automatically.<br>
                            <br>
                            Similarly, if a meditators frequently induce light visions (as prescribed in some types of meditation practice), and, to more specifically, if the meditators induce the visions of shrinking light-rings, then over time the firing threshold of those neurons in the visual pathways that participate in processing the ring-related signals will gradually be lowered.  When the firing thresholds of blue-processing neurons become lower and lower as ring visions keep getting induced, a threshold is reached at which time the blue-processing neurons begin to discharge even though previously they would have required higher levels of stimulation.  These neurons now respond to a relatively weak signal that they would previously have ignored.  From that moment on, the blue-processing neurons contribute signals to the composition of the color pattern.  The distribution of blue-processing neurons is such that the change from green to blue light only occurs in the fill-disk, not in the ring itself. </p>
